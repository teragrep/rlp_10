|mode|simple|Which mode to use. See modes for more information
|===

=== Modes

simple: Will flood identical static messages until each thread has sent total of maxRecordsSent. Fastest.

dynamic: Will flood dynamic messages until each thread has sent total of maxRecordsSent. Slower than simple but more dynamic content.

dynamic-shared: Will flood dynamic messages until total of maxRecordsSent records are sent across all threads. Slowest mode.
